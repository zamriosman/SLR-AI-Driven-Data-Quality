# Research Questions
1. How do specific data quality dimensions, such as accuracy, completeness, and consistency, impact the performance and reliability of AI-driven algorithms in the context of poor data quality, and what strategies can be developed to mitigate these effects?

2. What novel AI-driven techniques and data-driven methodologies can be developed to assess and enhance data quality across various dimensions, particularly in scenarios where data quality is inherently poor, such as in emerging markets or under-resourced domains?

3. How can data-driven approaches be leveraged to automatically detect and address data quality issues, including missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, within large and complex datasets, and how does the incorporation of AI-driven interventions improve the overall data quality and decision-making processes?

These research questions aim to explore the intricate relationship between data quality, AI-driven solutions, data-driven methodologies, and the challenges posed by poor data quality, offering opportunities to advance knowledge in these areas.
