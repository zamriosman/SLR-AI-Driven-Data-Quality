# Research Questions
## Here are three research questions related to AI-driven data quality:

1. How can AI-driven techniques and algorithms be effectively integrated into data quality assurance processes to automate the identification, cleaning, and enrichment of data, and what are the resulting improvements in data quality metrics and decision-making?

2. What are the key challenges and opportunities in developing AI-driven models for predicting data quality issues, such as missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, across diverse datasets, and how do these models perform in comparison to traditional data quality assessment methods?

3. In what ways can AI-driven approaches be employed to continuously monitor and adapt to changing data quality patterns and issues over time, and what are the implications for organizations seeking to maintain high data quality standards in dynamic and evolving data environments?

These research questions address the role of AI in enhancing data quality, including its applications, challenges, and potential benefits in ensuring high-quality data for various purposes.
