## Summary
Data integration is a crucial process in various domains, including toxicology, healthcare, and the public sector (Canzler et al., 2020; Dhayne et al., 2019; Hassan et al., 2020). It involves combining data from multiple sources to create a unified and comprehensive view of the data. However, data integration poses several challenges, particularly in terms of data quality (Daraio et al., 2022; Keulen, 2019; Zhang, 2018).

One of the challenges in data integration is the heterogeneity of data sources (Dhayne et al., 2019). Different sources may have varying data formats, structures, and quality levels, making it difficult to integrate them seamlessly. To address this challenge, approaches such as completeness-aware integration have been proposed (Daraio et al., 2022). These approaches aim to provide maximum information from integrated data systems without the need for extensive data quality analysis on individual databases (Daraio et al., 2022).

Data quality problems can be modeled as uncertainty in the integration process (Keulen, 2019). Uncertainty arises due to errors, inconsistencies, and missing values in the data. A probabilistic approach to data integration can help improve data quality by addressing uncertainty and enabling entity resolution and merging of grouped data (Keulen, 2019).

Another challenge in data integration is privacy preservation, especially when working with sensitive healthcare data (Deshpande et al., 2019). Privacy concerns require careful consideration and implementation of scalable privacy preservation techniques to ensure the confidentiality and security of the integrated data. Scalable privacy preservation methods can help improve the accuracy of the data integration process (Deshpande et al., 2019).

In the context of toxicology, multi-omics data integration has gained attention for its potential to improve the detection of pathway responses to toxicants (Canzler et al., 2020). Integrating multiple omics data sets can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of toxicants on biological pathways (Canzler et al., 2020). Re-analyzing published data has demonstrated that multi-omics data integration can significantly enhance the confidence in detecting pathway responses (Canzler et al., 2020). However, challenges remain in determining which omics layers contribute most to the identification of pathway responses (Canzler et al., 2020).

Data integration in the public sector is crucial for providing reliable and trustworthy data to stakeholders (Hassan et al., 2020). The public sector relies on creating value through services, and reliable data is essential for serving accurate information to stakeholders (Hassan et al., 2020). However, there is a lack of research in diagnosing the issues and challenges specific to data integration implementation in the public sector (Hassan et al., 2020). Identifying these challenges is essential for recommending best practices and ensuring the feasibility of data integration in the public sector (Hassan et al., 2020).

In the healthcare sector, data integration plays a vital role in enriching data and enhancing its value for efficient healthcare analytics (Dhayne et al., 2019). Data integration technologies and tools have been developed to support healthcare analytics, such as predicting diseases or outbreaks (Dhayne et al., 2019). Integrated information systems and electronic medical record reconciliation can improve perioperative data integrity and quality (Ryan et al., 2018).

To address data quality issues in integration, various approaches have been proposed. Some approaches focus on preventing and correcting errors in the data (Zhang, 2018). Others aim to ensure that selected data have satisfactory quality for a specific purpose, filtering out data that does not meet the required quality standards (Zhang, 2018). Creating a data quality frame model and defining quality rules can help improve data quality in integration (Zhang, 2018).

In conclusion, data integration is a complex process that involves combining data from multiple sources. Ensuring data quality is a critical challenge in data integration. Approaches such as completeness-aware integration, probabilistic data integration, and privacy preservation techniques can help address data quality issues. However, challenges remain in dealing with the heterogeneity of data sources and determining the most relevant omics layers in multi-omics data integration. In specific domains like the public sector and healthcare, data integration implementation requires careful consideration of organizational capabilities, privacy concerns, and stakeholder needs. Overall, addressing data quality challenges is essential for achieving accurate and reliable results in data integration.
